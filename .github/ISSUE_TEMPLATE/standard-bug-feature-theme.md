# Failure to follow the steps below will result in the ticket being immediately closed. Please read and respond carefully. 

## For Bug Reports
- Information and version about the operating system you are currently using:
  - For **Microsoft Windows** you can get this information by going to `Command Prompt` and using the `systeminfo` command.
  - For **MacOS** you can find this in your `Apple Menu` > `About`
  - For **Linux** you will need provide the following:
    - Which distro you are currently using?
    - Which version of the distro are you currently on?
    - Which kernel you are using?
    - What desktop environment are you using? (Please include details on the window server such as X11 or Wayland as well)
    - Are you using desktop compositing? (If you don't know, likely yes)
    - Determine if your system is currently up to date.
    - If you're a Gentoo/Arch/Manjaro/Slackware user, a list of installed packages and libraries is required for me to proceed. 
- A detailed description in list format on how to recreate the bug. (Don't hide it in a paragraph of text)
- Screenshots and Videos will speed up resolution time. If you can please, provide them.

## For Feature Enhancements
Please consider the following before submitting a ticket:
- Will this enhancement benefit more than yourself?
- Is it in the scope of the project or should it be directed towards another one like OBS?
- Is the enhancement you're asking for going to work-cross platform?

If all of the above is true, please submit a ticket with as much detail as you can provide.

## For Theme Requests
- Unless it is a group of themes that would benefit the community as a whole, I will not take theme requests for your own personal needs. There is plenty of examples and documentation on how to build your own here: https://ojdproject.com/developer-guide
- If you don't understand what the above means, think of it this way- would it be an enhancement to OJD that everyone would enjoy or just an aesthetic choice that would benefit you and your stream alone? If it's number two, I won't do it. I'm a single developer and I'm busy, also I don't take commissions don't ask.
